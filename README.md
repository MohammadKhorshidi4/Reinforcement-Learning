# Reinforcement-Learning
An agent tries to find the value the states using Temporal Difference algorithm with one reward one punishment and another one, two rewards and two punishments with less values than first reward and punishment.
We can see with lowe discount rate, there is no learning at all, and higher discount rate, the higher learning rate. Also, we can see that the agent never goes to punishment in later trials.
